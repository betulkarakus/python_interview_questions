Performance:\n","\n","- Tuples can be more memory-efficient than lists for small collections of data due to their immutability, resulting in less overhead.\n","\n","5. Ordered Sequences:\n","\n","- If the order of elements matters but you don't need to modify the sequence after creation, tuples are a suitable choice.\n","\n","6. Heterogeneous Data:\n","\n","- Tuples can contain elements of different data types, making them useful for representing collections with varied purposes.\n","\n","7. Iteration:\n","\n","- Tuples can be iterated over slightly faster than lists, making them efficient for scenarios where iteration performance is critical.\n","\n","8. String Formatting:\n","\n","- Tuples are often used in string formatting, where a fixed set of values needs to be inserted into a string.\n","\n","\n","While tuples offer immutability and specific use cases, lists are more versatile due to their mutability. Lists are preferable when you need to modify the sequence of elements or require extensive methods for manipulation. The choice between a tuple and a list depends on the specific requirements of your program."],"metadata":{"id":"OiuAfumm2s3i"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q40.
